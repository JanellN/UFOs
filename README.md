## Purpose 
In the project we will analyze data using Javascript functions that will organize and store data be shared on an HTML webpage.  Through our analysis we will filter through and organize UFO sighting data with ultiple criteria at the same time.  

## Results

From our analysis, we now have a filter search tool that we can use to find data based on the date, city, country and/or shape.  With using the search tool, you have option to narrow your search by using up to all of the search criteria options.  After entering your search criteria, the page will filter throught the data and shown you entries that align.  The image above reflects the output you would receive without entering any search criteria.  Therefore, all data that has been imported will be listed and you can scroll through the page to view them all.  If you are looking for a more consise list of results, the filter search options will provide this for you.

From this image, we filtered our search by date and shape.  As you can see, this is a far smaller list than the image previously shown. 

## Summary

Our current webpage provides a great foundation to filter through the UFO sighting data.  One drawback would be the lack of knowledge around the daterange of the dataset.  Fortunately, our dataset is fairly small and if we were to conduct a search without using filters (as above) we can scroll through the page and glance at the dates that are listed.  The issue with could come if the dataset was larger and it was more inconvenient to scroll through the entire page.  One recommendation to adjust this would be to either state the date range within the placeholder field in the script or to provide a dropdown list on our search toolbar that would list the date options.  This would also be helpful for the other search fields.  It is also noticed that the search fields are case sensitive.  Adjusting our code to remove the case sensitivity would create a more user-friendly experience.
